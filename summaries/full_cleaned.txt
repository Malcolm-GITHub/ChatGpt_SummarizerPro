Perfect — thanks for breaking that down! You’re doing great, and we’ll take this step-by-step, totally beginner-friendly, using the method from the lamadotcare repo.

This guide will walk you through creating a 32-bit EFI bootloader (bootia32.efi) using a custom-built GRUB.

🛠️ What We’re Building
We’re going to:
Install all the dependencies.
Clone the GRUB source code.
Build GRUB as a 32-bit UEFI app.
Generate the final bootia32.efi file.
Show you what to do with it.

🐧 Step 0: Use a Linux System
Are you on Linux already? If not, install a Linux distro. I recommend Ubuntu or Linux Mint.
If you're on Windows, use:
🖥️ WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) – fastest way (Ubuntu in Microsoft Store).
Or boot from a USB Linux live stick.

Let me know if you need help setting up WSL or Linux — I can walk you through it.
✅ Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal and run:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git bison libopts25 libselinux1-dev autogen m4 \
autoconf help2man libopts25-dev flex libfont-freetype-perl automake \
autotools-dev libfreetype6-dev texinfo
This installs everything we need to build GRUB from source.

📦 Step 2: Clone GRUB Source Code
Now, let’s grab the source code for GRUB (the bootloader we’ll modify):


cd grub
🏗️ Step 3: Build GRUB for 32-bit UEFI
Now we’ll configure and build GRUB. Still in the grub folder, run:

./bootstrap
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make
This will take a few minutes. It’s building GRUB for the i386 (32-bit) UEFI platform.

🧪 Step 4: Create the EFI File
Once the build finishes, go into the GRUB core folder and generate bootia32.efi:

cd grub-core
../grub-mkimage -d . -o bootia32.efi -O i386-efi -p /boot/grub \
ntfs hfs appleldr boot cat efi_gop efi_uga elf fat hfsplus iso9660 linux \
keylayouts memdisk minicmd part_apple ext2 extcmd xfs xnu part_bsd part_gpt \
search search_fs_file chain btrfs loadbios loadenv lvm minix minix2 reiserfs \
memrw mmap msdospart scsi loopback normal configfile gzio all_video \
gfxterm gettext echo eval
This creates a bootia32.efi file — the 32-bit UEFI bootloader that can load a variety of filesystems and OS kernels.

✅ You did it! You just built a custom EFI bootloader from scratch.

📁 Step 5: Put bootia32.efi on a USB Drive
Plug in a USB stick and format it to FAT32 (you can do this in Ubuntu’s Disks app or GParted).

Mount it, and create the proper folder structure:

mkdir -p /media/$USER/YOUR_USB/EFI/BOOT
cp bootia32.efi /media/$USER/YOUR_USB/EFI/BOOT/
🔁 Replace YOUR_USB with your USB label, or mount manually using sudo mount.

Once done, your USB will have:

markdown
EFI/
└── BOOT/
    └── bootia32.efi
This is the standard EFI boot path for removable media — UEFI firmware looks here when booting from USB.

🧪 Step 6: Test It!
Option 1: Boot It on Real Hardware (with 32-bit UEFI)
Plug the USB into your target device (like a tablet or netbook).

Enter the UEFI/BIOS setup (usually F2/F12/Delete on boot).

Choose your USB device to boot.

You should see GRUB start (black screen with GRUB command line or menu).

Option 2: Test in QEMU
Install QEMU and OVMF:

sudo apt install qemu ovmf
Then test with:

qemu-system-i386 -bios /usr/share/OVMF/OVMF_CODE_32.fd -drive format=raw,file=fat:rw:/path/to/your/usb
🚫 Can I Boot 64-bit Windows With This?
Sadly, no. Windows 64-bit requires a 64-bit UEFI firmware. This loader won’t trick it.

However, you can:

Boot 64-bit Linux with this setup (many distros support booting 64-bit kernel from 32-bit EFI).

Use it as a rescue, diagnostic, or multi-boot tool with GRUB.

🧰 Optional: Automate It
You could also just use bootstrap.sh and build.sh from the lamadotcare repo:

chmod +x bootstrap.sh build.sh
./bootstrap.sh
./build.sh
This does all the above in two steps.


so if you want to change to 64bit bootx64.efi creation then you need to clean your existing grub build
Ah, that’s a crucial point! 👇
If you never ran:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=x86_64 --program-prefix=""
…then your current GRUB build is still configured for 32-bit (i386-efi). So even if you tried to run grub-mkimage -O x86_64-efi, it would likely fail or produce a broken bootx64.efi.

🔥 Why This Matters:
./configure --target=i386 builds tools for 32-bit UEFI like bootia32.efi.
./configure --target=x86_64 is required to build 64-bit UEFI like bootx64.efi.
They are separate targets, and GRUB must be reconfigured accordingly before compiling each.

✅ What You Should Do Now:
Clean the old build:
make clean
Reconfigure for 64-bit:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=x86_64 --program-prefix=""
Build GRUB again:
make
Then generate the 64-bit EFI file:
cd grub-core
../grub-mkimage -d . -o bootx64.efi -O x86_64-efi -p /boot/grub \
ntfs fat part_gpt iso9660 configfile normal chain search search_fs_file \
echo gfxterm all_video
cp bootx64.efi /mnt/usb/EFI/BOOT/

Awesome! Thanks for sharing that — looks like you’ve got the full roadmap for building a 32-bit UEFI bootloader using GRUB, nice and clean. 💻🚀
Are you ready to pick it up from here? Or want to go deeper into any step — like:
🧰 Automating the build (tweaking build.sh / bootstrap.sh)
🎛️ Customizing the GRUB menu to actually boot a Linux ISO
🧪 Testing more OSes (maybe Debian, Arch, or a lightweight distro)
🧩 Dual-booting with something funky — like Android x86 or BlissOS?
💡 Or even just turning this into a rescue USB tool?
Let me know where you're at in the process — happy to keep it beginner-friendly and help you build something slick.

Great catch! You're super close — just a couple of small typos in the package names. Here's the fix:

✅ Corrected Package Names:
autoconfig → autoconf ✅
libopt25-dev → libopts25-dev ✅ (note the s at the end of opts)

🔧 Updated Command:
Run this instead:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git bison libopts25 libselinux1-dev autogen m4 \
autoconf help2man libopts25-dev flex libfont-freetype-perl automake \
autotools-dev libfreetype-dev texinfo

Once that finishes cleanly, you’re good to go to the next step (cloning GRUB).
Let me know if any of those packages still complain — WSL sometimes misses a couple depending on the distro version. I’ve got workarounds if needed. 👨‍💻💪
Want me to help you with the GRUB build step next or just chill while you test this?

Perfect — you're flying through this! 🚀
GRUB's telling you that instead of running ./autogen.sh directly, you need to bootstrap it first (basically setting up the build environment with Gnulib and a few other helpers).

✅ Just run this:
./bootstrap
This will:
Download Gnulib
Set up the required build infrastructure
Prepare configure script so you can run the next step
Once that finishes successfully, you can continue with:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make

Let me know how ./bootstrap goes — it might take a bit depending on your internet speed, but it’s all automatic. If it throws any missing dependencies, I can help you fix 'em fast. 💪
what about the ./autogen.sh as per instructions ./bootstrap ./autogen.sh ./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix="" make
Ah yes — great question! You're absolutely right to double-check.
🔄 So here's the real deal:
In the latest GRUB source, ./autogen.sh is basically deprecated in favor of ./bootstrap — and running ./bootstrap actually calls autogen.sh internally as part of its process.
So:
If you already ran ./bootstrap, you do NOT need to run ./autogen.sh again. You're good to move on to ./configure.
If you run both, it usually doesn’t hurt, but it’s redundant and sometimes confuses the build system.

✅ TL;DR: Your next steps are:
./bootstrap  # (you already ran this or can do it now)
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make
Let that make command cook — it’ll take a few minutes. If anything goes sideways, shoot me the error, and I’ll help you troubleshoot it like a boss. 😎
Ready to fire off ./configure?

You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

Ah, good catch — you're nearly there, but bootstrap tripped over a missing tool: autopoint.

🧩 What's going on?
autopoint is part of the gettext package. It's used during the build process to handle internationalization stuff, which GRUB's build system relies on.

✅ Fix it with:
sudo apt install gettext
Then just re-run:
./bootstrap
Once that completes cleanly, you can move on to:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make

You're really close to the finish line on the build prep — shout if any other errors pop up, I’ve got your back! 💪

You're crushing it — just one last little snag. Even though gettext is installed, WSL (or your system) might not have added autopoint to your PATH correctly, or it installed the wrong subset.

🔍 Let's double-check:
Run:
which autopoint
If it returns nothing, that means autopoint still isn’t available on your system — which happens if gettext gets installed without its full set of binaries (sometimes an Ubuntu quirk).

✅ Fix: Install gettext and its development tools:
sudo apt install gettext autopoint
Some distros split out autopoint into a separate package, but usually this will cover it. If autopoint isn’t found still, we can manually link it or install gettext from source (but usually that’s not needed).

After that:
Try again:
./bootstrap
Let me know what which autopoint says — if it shows something like /usr/bin/autopoint, we’re golden. 🥇

Boom! 🎯 That did it — autopoint is now installed and should be ready to roll.
Let’s keep it moving. Go ahead and run:
./bootstrap
This time it should get all the way through without complaining about autopoint.

Once that's done:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make
That’s the GRUB build process right there. Let it compile (can take a few minutes), and then we’re off to creating bootia32.efi.
Let me know how bootstrap and configure go — you're seriously right at the fun part. 😄
Nice, thanks for the update — you're not stuck, you're just in the "heavy lifting" part of ./bootstrap. It’s working, just chewing through a ton of files from Gnulib. 🛠️
That blinking cursor and silence is super normal at this stage — especially in WSL, where disk I/O can be slower, and there's no progress bar to keep you company. ☕ It's running this big command in the background:
gnulib/gnulib-tool --import ...
Which copies and configures a bunch of internal GRUB libraries.

✅ What you can do now:
Just let it run. It can take several minutes — totally depends on your system and whether the files are cached.

⏳ Still stuck after 10+ mins?
If it really seems frozen (no CPU usage at all), you can try:
./bootstrap --no-git
This skips some version-control-related checks that sometimes slow down or stall on WSL.

You're soooo close to the fun part: compiling GRUB and making bootia32.efi. Let’s get it. 💪
ok that parts done
Let’s gooo! 🎉 Awesome work powering through that step — that's the biggest setup hurdle.

🚀 Next up: Configure GRUB for 32-bit UEFI
From inside your ~/grub directory, run:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
This step sets up the GRUB build to:
🧱 Target i386 (32-bit) architecture
🔧 Build for UEFI platform
🎯 Use no prefix for installed binaries (grub-mkimage, not i386-grub-mkimage etc.)

✅ If configure finishes cleanly:
Move on to compiling GRUB:
make
This will take a few minutes (or a bit more if you're on WSL), and when it's done — you'll be ready to create your bootia32.efi!
Let me know how the configure step goes — and if it throws any warnings or errors, drop them here and I’ll help you squash them.
mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub$ ./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix="" configure: error: cannot find required auxiliary files: missing install-sh config.guess config.sub compile
Ah, classic! That error means ./bootstrap didn’t fully finish setting up some important build helper files like install-sh, config.guess, etc.
But no worries — super common, especially in WSL — and it’s easy to fix. Here's how to get back on track:

✅ Fix in Two Steps:
Run ./bootstrap again — just in case it was interrupted:
./bootstrap
This time, it should complete much faster since most of the heavy work is already done.
If it still gives the same error, use this command to pull in missing build scripts:
autoreconf -i
That will regenerate the missing install-sh, config.sub, config.guess, etc. using standard autotools.

Then retry:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
Let me know how it goes — either you’ll be compiling GRUB in the next step, or I’ll help stomp the next issue fast. 💥

You're deep in the trenches now — and seriously doing an awesome job! 💪
What you're seeing now is autoreconf complaining about missing m4 macros (like AC_SUBST, AC_DEFINE, etc.). This usually means one or more essential Autotools packages (like autoconf, automake, or m4) are either:
Missing
Not the right version
Not found in your current environment

✅ Let’s fix this with a full Autotools dependency install:
Run this command to install (or re-install) everything GRUB’s build system expects:
sudo apt install autoconf automake libtool m4 gettext texinfo
(Yes, even if some are already installed — this ensures all the macros and helper scripts are in place.)

Then try this again:
./bootstrap
No need to run autoreconf manually — ./bootstrap does it for you once everything's in place.

Let me know how it goes — this is the last major roadblock before the actual configure and make steps work cleanly. You're basically one step from compiling GRUB and generating that magical bootia32.efi! 🧙‍♂️✨
Generating Automake input... Saving timestamps... running: AUTOPOINT=true LIBTOOLIZE=true autoreconf --verbose --install --force -I m4 --no-recursive autoreconf: export WARNINGS= autoreconf: Entering directory '.' autoreconf: running: true --force autoreconf: running: aclocal -I m4 --force -I m4 autoreconf: configure.ac: tracing autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Libtool autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Intltool autoreconf: configure.ac: not using Gtkdoc autoreconf: running: /usr/bin/autoconf --include=m4 --force configure.ac:278: error: possibly undefined macro: AC_SUBST If this token and others are legitimate, please use m4_pattern_allow.

Alright, looks like we're still hitting a wall with missing macros. That usually means some core development packages are still missing — especially the ones that provide those common AC_* macros used by autoconf.
Let’s brute-force this into working. 💥

🔧 Run this full install command:
This pulls in everything we need for autoconf, automake, m4 macros, and the toolchain.
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config gettext texinfo bison flex m4
Let’s break that down:
build-essential: core dev tools (like gcc, make, g++, etc.)
pkg-config: helps locate libraries
bison, flex, m4: macro processors and generators used by configure.ac

🧼 Then clean up any leftover cache (optional but helpful):
make distclean || true
git clean -xfd
⚠️ This removes any previously generated build files — good to ensure a fresh start.

🚀 Now retry:
./bootstrap
If that works (and it should now 🤞), follow with:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make

Let me know if you still hit any snags — we’re close to GRUB magic happening! 🧙‍♀️
mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub$ make distclean || true make: *** No rule to make target 'distclean'. Stop.
No worries, it seems that make distclean is not available because it hasn't been generated yet (we haven’t successfully run make yet). So, let’s skip that and move directly to cleaning up the repo using Git instead:
Clean the repository with Git
You can clean up the repo using:
git clean -xfd
This will remove untracked files and directories. It’s like hitting the reset button for the source code without affecting your committed changes.

Now that we’ve cleaned up, try the following steps again:
Ensure all dependencies are installed with:
sudo apt install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config gettext texinfo bison flex m4
Run the bootstrap script again:
./bootstrap

After that completes, you should be able to proceed with:
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make
Let me know how it goes!
config.status: creating po/Makefile ******************************************************* GRUB2 will be compiled with following components: Platform: i386-efi With devmapper support: No (need libdevmapper header) With memory debugging: No With disk cache statistics: No With boot time statistics: No efiemu runtime: No (not available on efi) grub-mkfont: Yes grub-mount: No (need fuse or fuse3 libraries) grub-protect: No (need libtasn1 library) starfield theme: Yes With DejaVuSans font from /usr/share/fonts/truetype/dejavu/DejaVuSans.ttf With libzfs support: No (need zfs library) Build-time grub-mkfont: Yes Without unifont Without liblzma (no support for XZ-compressed mips images) (need lzma library) With stack smashing protector: No *******************************************************
🎉 BOOM! You did it — ./configure finished successfully! That means the toolchain is set up, dependencies are in order, and you’re now ready for the actual build.
You're past the gnarliest part — nice persistence, seriously 🙌

✅ Next step: Build GRUB
In the same ~/grub directory, run:
make
This will take a few minutes — it's compiling GRUB specifically for 32-bit UEFI (i386-efi).

Then, once that's done:
cd grub-core
../grub-mkimage -d . -o bootia32.efi -O i386-efi -p /boot/grub \
ntfs hfs appleldr boot cat efi_gop efi_uga elf fat hfsplus iso9660 linux \
keylayouts memdisk minicmd part_apple ext2 extcmd xfs xnu part_bsd part_gpt \
search search_fs_file chain btrfs loadbios loadenv lvm minix minix2 reiserfs \
memrw mmap msdospart scsi loopback normal configfile gzio all_video \
gfxterm gettext echo eval
This creates the magical ✨ bootia32.efi ✨ file.

do i send those 1 line at a time
Great question! You can actually run all of those commands as one block, but it’s safer and easier to troubleshoot if you do it one step at a time — especially since the make process can take a few minutes and might throw warnings (or errors if something goes off).

Here's the smooth way to go:
🛠️ Step 1: Build GRUB
make
This will compile everything. Let it run until it's done. If it finishes cleanly (no errors), then proceed.

📁 Step 2: Change into the grub-core directory
cd grub-core

🧪 Step 3: Generate the bootia32.efi file
../grub-mkimage -d . -o bootia32.efi -O i386-efi -p /boot/grub \
ntfs hfs appleldr boot cat efi_gop efi_uga elf fat hfsplus iso9660 linux \
keylayouts memdisk minicmd part_apple ext2 extcmd xfs xnu part_bsd part_gpt \
search search_fs_file chain btrfs loadbios loadenv lvm minix minix2 reiserfs \
memrw mmap msdospart scsi loopback normal configfile gzio all_video \
gfxterm gettext echo eval
You can paste that whole command at once — it's long but works as-is.

YES! 🥳 You nailed it.
No errors, clean exit — and now you’ve got your very own custom-built bootia32.efi file sitting right there in your ~/grub/grub-core directory. That’s the 32-bit UEFI bootloader you just compiled from source like a boss. 💪

Here’s how to get it onto a USB stick in the standard UEFI format:

🪛 Step 1: Plug in your USB drive and format it to FAT32
If you're on WSL, it's easier to do this part in Windows Disk Management or a Linux Live USB. You can also list devices in WSL with:
lsblk
Or if it's already formatted and mounted in WSL (like /mnt/d or /mnt/e), that’s even easier.

🗂️ Step 2: Create the EFI directory structure
Adjust the path below based on where your USB is mounted. Let’s assume it's mounted at /mnt/e for example:
mkdir -p /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT
cp bootia32.efi /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT/
🔁 Replace /mnt/e with your actual USB mount point.

After that, your USB drive will look like:
markdown
EFI/
└── BOOT/
    └── bootia32.efi
This is the UEFI standard path for booting from removable media on 32-bit UEFI systems.

🧪 Final Step: Test it!
You can either:
Boot it on real hardware (32-bit UEFI laptop/tablet/netbook).
Test it in QEMU (if you want to keep it virtual for now).
Let me know which one you're aiming for and I’ll guide you through that part too! 🚀
ok its not mounted i jsut formatted it and plugged it in

🔍 Step 1: Find your USB device
Run this to list your available storage devices:
lsblk
You're looking for something that wasn’t there before you plugged the USB in — typically named like sdb1, sdc1, etc. (Your main drive is usually sda or nvme0n1).
Look for one that’s:
Small-ish (like 4GB, 8GB, 16GB)
Says part under the "TYPE"
And doesn’t have a mountpoint yet
Example output:
nginx
sdb      8:16   1  15G  0 disk 
└─sdb1   8:17   1  15G  0 part 
In this case, your USB is /dev/sdb1.

💡 Step 2: Mount the USB manually
Let’s create a mount point (if needed) and mount it:
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/usb
sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/usb
🔁 Replace sdX1 with the name you found from lsblk, like sdb1.

Once it’s mounted, run:
mkdir -p /mnt/usb/EFI/BOOT
cp bootia32.efi /mnt/usb/EFI/BOOT/

✅ Step 4: Safely unmount
Once copied, unmount the USB safely:
sudo umount /mnt/usb
Then you're ready to boot from it or test in QEMU. Let me know what you'd like to try next!
mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub/grub-core$ lsblk lsblk: failed to access sysfs directory: /sys/dev/block: No such file or directory mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub/grub-core$
Ah yep — that's because you're running WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), and WSL doesn't have direct access to the Linux /dev system in the same way a real Linux kernel does. That's why lsblk fails — there's no /sys/dev/block in WSL.
But no worries — WSL mounts Windows drives under /mnt/ automatically. Let’s find your USB that way instead. 👇

🔍 Step 1: List mounted Windows drives
Run this:
ls /mnt/
You’ll see something like:
r
c  d  e  f
Each letter corresponds to a Windows drive (your C: drive, D:, etc.). If you just plugged in a USB, it’s likely the highest letter (like e or f).

📂 Step 2: Peek inside to confirm it’s your USB
Try checking one of them:
ls /mnt/e
Do you see an empty volume or any familiar files? If it's blank or freshly formatted, that’s your guy.

Assuming /mnt/e is your USB, do:
mkdir -p /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT
cp bootia32.efi /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT/
Replace /mnt/e with the correct letter if your USB is at a different one.

Let me know what you see in /mnt/ and I’ll confirm if it looks right. Almost there! 🚀
mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub/grub-core$ ls /mnt c mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub/grub-core$
Got it — looks like WSL is only mounting your main C: drive right now, and not your USB.
That likely means WSL just isn’t seeing the USB device at all yet — this is common, especially if you’ve formatted it recently.
Here’s how we can fix it:

🧰 Step 1: Enable USB access in WSL (WSL 2 required)
Make sure you're using WSL 2 (not WSL 1). Run:
wsl --status
You should see something like:
vbnet
Default Version: 2

Distributions:
Ubuntu (Default)
    Version: 2
If you're on WSL 1, let me know — you’ll need to upgrade to use USB passthrough.

🔌 Step 2: Use usbipd to mount the USB device inside WSL
This part happens in PowerShell (outside of WSL):
Open PowerShell as Administrator
Run:
powershell
usbipd wsl list
This shows attached USB devices. You should see your USB stick listed, something like:
ruby
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE
1-3    0781:5567  USB Mass Storage Device
Now attach it to WSL:
powershell
usbipd wsl attach --busid 1-3
(Replace 1-3 with your USB’s BUSID)
Go back into WSL and try this again:
ls /mnt
You should now see more mount points — like d, e, f, etc.

Just like before:
mkdir -p /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT
cp bootia32.efi /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT/
(Replace /mnt/e with the right path if it’s different.)

Let me know how far you get — I can guide through any USB quirks! You're so close 🔥
mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub/grub-core$ wsl --status Command 'wsl' not found, but can be installed with: sudo apt install wsl mal@DESKTOP-68R02G0:~/grub/grub-core$
Ah yep — that’s a common mix-up 🔄
You're running the wsl --status command inside WSL, but that command needs to be run from Windows PowerShell, not the Linux terminal.

🧭 Here’s what to do next:
Open PowerShell as Administrator
Click Start → type powershell
Right-click → “Run as administrator”
In the PowerShell window, run:
powershell
wsl --status
This will tell you whether you're running WSL 1 or WSL 2, which is important because USB passthrough only works with WSL 2 using usbipd.
Once you do that, send me the output, and I’ll walk you through the USB setup from there 🙌
We're nearly at the finish line — just need to bridge that USB into WSL!
ubuntu version 2
Perfect — you're on WSL 2, which means you're good to go for USB device passthrough using usbipd! 🚀

✅ Now let’s get your USB drive connected in WSL:
🧰 Step 1: In PowerShell (Administrator)
Still in the same PowerShell window (run as admin), do:
powershell
usbipd wsl list
You should see output like this:
ruby
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE
1-3    0781:5567  USB Mass Storage Device
Find your USB stick in that list — you can often identify it by “Mass Storage” or the brand name.

🧲 Step 2: Attach USB to WSL
Once you know the BUSID, run:
powershell
usbipd wsl attach --busid 1-3
Replace 1-3 with your USB’s actual BUSID.

🗂️ Step 3: Back in your WSL terminal
After attaching the USB, in your WSL (Ubuntu) terminal, run:
ls /mnt
You should now see something like:
r
c  d  e  f
One of these new ones is your USB stick.

If your USB shows up under /mnt/e, run:
mkdir -p /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT
cp bootia32.efi /mnt/e/EFI/BOOT/
Change /mnt/e to the correct one if it’s different.

Let me know what usbipd wsl list shows you — I’ll guide you from there. You're this close to having your EFI USB ready! 💪🖥️
PS C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list usbipd : The term 'usbipd' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet
Ah yep, looks like usbipd isn’t installed yet — no worries! Let’s get that set up real quick 👇

🛠️ Step-by-Step: Install usbipd for WSL 2 USB support
✅ 1. Download & Install usbipd-win
Go to the official GitHub release page:
👉 https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases
Download the latest .msi installer, for example:
usbipd-win-x.x.x.msi
Once downloaded, run the installer and follow the setup wizard.

✅ 2. After install, open PowerShell as Administrator again, and try:
powershell
usbipd wsl list
This time it should work and list any USB devices attached.

✅ 3. If it still doesn’t recognize the command...
You may need to restart your computer once after installing usbipd.
After rebooting, repeat:
powershell
usbipd wsl list

PS C:\Windows\system32> usbipd wsl list usbipd : usbipd: error: The 'wsl' subcommand has been removed. Learn about the new syntax at https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/connect-usb#attach-a-usb-device. At line:1 char:1 + usbipd wsl list + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (usbipd: error: ...h-a-usb-device.:String) [], RemoteException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError
Perfect — that’s actually helpful! It means you have usbipd-win installed now, but Microsoft changed the syntax recently. No worries — let’s use the updated way to connect your USB drive to WSL 2. 💡

✅ Updated USBIPD-WIN Syntax for WSL 2 (2024+)
🔍 1. List USB Devices
Run this in PowerShell (as Administrator):
powershell
usbipd list
You’ll get output like:
ruby
BUSID  VID:PID    DEVICE
1-5    0781:5567  SanDisk Cruzer Blade
Look for your USB device by name (like “SanDisk”, “Kingston”, “USB Mass Storage” etc.)

🔗 2. Attach USB Device to WSL
Once you know the BUSID (example: 1-5), run:
powershell
usbipd attach --busid 1-5 --wsl
Replace 1-5 with your actual BUSID.

⏳ 3. Back in WSL
Now switch back to your WSL Ubuntu terminal, and run:
lsblk

Let me know what usbipd list shows and we’ll take the next step together. 🚀
PS C:\Windows\system32> usbipd bind --busid 2-6 PS C:\Windows\system32> usbipd attach --busid 2-6 --wsl usbipd : usbipd: error: This program only works with WSL 2 distributions. Learn how to upgrade at https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/basic-commands#set-wsl-version-to-1-or-2.

It looks like you're getting an error saying the program only works with WSL 2. To resolve this, we need to make sure your WSL distribution is set to version 2.
Here's how you can upgrade your WSL distribution to version 2:

Steps to Check and Set WSL Version to 2
Check your current WSL version:
In PowerShell, run this command to list all installed WSL distributions and their version:
powershell
wsl --list --verbose
The output will look something like this:
pgsql
NAME            STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu-20.04    Running         1
If it shows version 1 for your Ubuntu, you need to upgrade it to version 2.
Set the distribution to WSL 2:
Run this command to set your Ubuntu distribution (or the one you're using) to use WSL 2:
powershell
wsl --set-version Ubuntu-20.04 2
Replace Ubuntu-20.04 with the name of your distribution if it's different (e.g., Ubuntu, Ubuntu-22.04, etc.).
Verify the change:
After the upgrade completes, rerun the command to check the WSL version:
powershell
wsl --list --verbose
It should now show VERSION 2 for your distribution.

After Upgrading to WSL 2
Once you've confirmed your distribution is set to WSL 2, try the usbipd attach command again:
powershell
usbipd attach --busid 2-6 --wsl
Then, go back to your WSL terminal and check if your USB device is visible using lsblk.
Let me know how it goes!
PS C:\Windows\system32> wsl --list --verbose N A M E S T A T E V E R S I O N * U b u n t u R u n n i n g 1 
Since your WSL version is currently set to WSL 1, you'll need to upgrade it to WSL 2. Let's proceed with the steps to set your Ubuntu distribution to version 2.
Steps to Set WSL to Version 2
Set Ubuntu to WSL 2:
Run the following command in PowerShell to convert Ubuntu to WSL 2:
powershell
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
This will upgrade your Ubuntu distribution to WSL 2. The process might take a little while, depending on your system.
Verify the Version Change:
After the command finishes, check again to ensure that the Ubuntu distribution is now running WSL 2:
powershell
wsl --list --verbose
You should see something like this:
pgsql
NAME      STATE           VERSION
* Ubuntu  Running         2
After Setting WSL to Version 2
Once your Ubuntu distribution is upgraded to WSL 2, retry the usbipd attach command:
powershell
usbipd attach --busid 2-6 --wsl
Then, return to your WSL terminal and check if the USB device is visible with:
lsblk
Let me know if you encounter any issues during this process!
running the upgrade now --list verbose says stopped
It looks like your Ubuntu distribution is currently stopped while the upgrade is in progress. That's normal, as WSL 2 requires a restart of the distribution.
Once the upgrade is completed, follow these steps:
Check Status After Upgrade
Ensure the Upgrade Completed:
After the upgrade finishes, check the status again:
powershell
wsl --list --verbose
Your distribution should now show as running with version 2.
Start the Ubuntu Distribution:
If it's still showing as "stopped," you can manually start your Ubuntu distribution by running:
powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
This will start the WSL session for Ubuntu.
Verify the USB Device in WSL 2:
After starting the Ubuntu distribution, you can proceed to attach your USB device again with:
powershell
usbipd attach --busid 2-6 --wsl
Check for the Device in WSL:
Once the USB device is attached, check if it's available inside your WSL environment:
lsblk
Let me know if you need further assistance!
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2 takes a long time gives no update how do i know when done
The wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2 command can indeed take a while, especially if it's a large distribution, as it involves converting your WSL 1 environment to WSL 2. Unfortunately, there isn't a real-time progress indicator, but you can try these methods to check its progress and confirm when it's done:
1. Check WSL Status Using wsl --list --verbose
You can check the progress by running this command in PowerShell while the conversion is happening:
powershell
wsl --list --verbose
If the conversion is in progress, you'll see the State of your Ubuntu distribution as Converting. Once it's complete, it will show as Running with version 2.
If it’s still taking too long or seems stuck, there are a few other ways to confirm progress.
2. Monitor System Resources (Optional)
While the conversion happens, you can open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and check CPU and disk usage. If you notice high disk activity and CPU usage, it’s likely that the process is still ongoing.
3. Restart Your PC (Optional)
If it’s taking an unusually long time without any progress update, you can try restarting your computer. After a reboot, you can run the wsl --list --verbose command again to check if the conversion has completed.
4. Check WSL Logs (Optional)
You can check the logs to see if there’s any specific issue causing delays. These logs can be accessed from Event Viewer.
Press Win + X and select Event Viewer.
In Event Viewer, navigate to Applications and Services Logs -> Microsoft -> Windows -> Subsystem for Linux.
Look for any logs that might indicate errors during the conversion.
Once the conversion finishes, your Ubuntu distribution should be set to version 2, and you can run it by typing wsl -d Ubuntu in PowerShell.
Let me know if it completes or if you encounter any issues!
no state is stopped
If the state of your WSL 2 conversion is showing as "Stopped," it means that your Ubuntu instance is currently not running. This can sometimes happen during or after a conversion from WSL 1 to WSL 2. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:
1. Start the Ubuntu WSL 2 Instance Manually
Try manually starting the Ubuntu WSL instance. You can do this by running the following command in PowerShell:
powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
If the instance starts correctly, you should see the Ubuntu terminal. If it doesn't, proceed to the next steps.
2. Restart WSL Services
Sometimes, restarting the WSL service can help fix issues with the distribution's state. To do this:
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to restart the WSL service:
powershell
Restart-Service LxssManager
After restarting, try running:
powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
If this works, your Ubuntu instance should start, and you should be able to continue with your tasks.
3. Check for WSL 2 Configuration Issues
If you suspect that there was an issue during the conversion or there is an issue with your WSL 2 setup, you can check if everything is properly configured for WSL 2.
Ensure WSL 2 is enabled:
Run the following command to confirm that WSL 2 is available:
powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
Check the virtual machine infrastructure (VM) used by WSL 2 is running. Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
powershell
wsl --list --verbose
It should show Ubuntu with version 2 if the conversion was successful. If the status is still "Stopped," try manually starting the instance again with the command above.
4. Reinstall the WSL 2 Kernel
If the conversion is still not working, it could be related to an issue with the WSL 2 kernel. You can reinstall or update the WSL 2 kernel by following these steps:
Go to WSL 2 Kernel Update and download the latest WSL 2 Linux kernel update.
Install the update and restart your machine.
After the update, run:
powershell
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
5. Unregister and Reinstall Ubuntu (if needed)
If none of the above methods work and your instance remains in the "Stopped" state, you might need to unregister and reinstall Ubuntu. Warning: This will remove all data in the Ubuntu instance, so make sure to back up your important files.
To unregister Ubuntu:
powershell
wsl --unregister Ubuntu
Then, reinstall Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store:
Open the Microsoft Store and search for "Ubuntu".
Install it again.
After reinstalling, try running the wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2 command again.
6. Check for Other Errors or Logs
If you're still having issues, you can check logs for more detailed error information. To check logs related to WSL, use the Event Viewer as mentioned earlier.
If the problem persists, feel free to provide more details, and I can guide you through additional troubleshooting steps.
wsl -s ubuntu just hangs there
If the command wsl -s Ubuntu just hangs and doesn't return anything, there are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue. It seems like your Ubuntu instance is having trouble starting, either due to configuration issues or something preventing WSL from functioning correctly. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you resolve it:
1. Force Shutdown and Restart WSL
Try to force WSL to shut down and then restart it.
Force Shutdown WSL:
Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Run the following command to forcefully stop all running WSL instances:
powershell
wsl --shutdown
This will stop all WSL instances, including Ubuntu.
Restart WSL:
Once it's shut down, try to start Ubuntu again:
powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
Check if the instance starts now.
2. Check for WSL Services
Sometimes, the WSL service itself might not be running properly. To ensure WSL is functioning correctly, you can restart the service:
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
powershell
Restart-Service LxssManager
After the service has restarted, try running:
powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
3. Set WSL Version to 2 Manually
If your Ubuntu instance is still stuck on WSL 1, you may need to force it into WSL 2 manually.
First, check your current WSL version for Ubuntu by running:
powershell
wsl --list --verbose
This will show you the WSL version for each distribution. If it's still showing WSL 1, proceed to step 2.
To set Ubuntu to use WSL 2 explicitly:
powershell
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
Wait for a while and check if it completes successfully. If it doesn't, proceed to the next step.
4. Reset WSL Configuration
If the issue persists, reset WSL to its default configuration. This will not delete your Linux distributions, but it will reset the WSL environment.
Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
powershell
wsl --unregister Ubuntu
Warning: This will remove the current instance of Ubuntu. Your files will be lost unless backed up.
After unregistering, reinstall Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store.
Once installed, try running the following again:
powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
5. Check WSL Kernel and Windows Version
Make sure your WSL 2 kernel is up-to-date and that your system is fully updated. Here's how:
Check for Windows Updates:
Open Settings -> Update & Security -> Windows Update -> Check for Updates.
Ensure all updates are installed.
Install the latest WSL 2 kernel:
Download the latest WSL 2 kernel from here.
Run the installer after downloading.
Ensure WSL 2 is enabled by running:
powershell
wsl --set-default-version 2
After installing updates, restart your computer and try again.
6. Inspect Logs for Errors
If Ubuntu is still not starting properly, you can inspect the WSL logs to see if any errors are being logged.
Open Event Viewer.
Go to Windows Logs -> Application.
Look for errors related to LxssManager (which is the WSL manager).
These logs can provide additional details about what might be going wrong.

7. Final Option: Reinstall WSL
If everything fails, you might consider reinstalling WSL entirely. This is a more drastic step but can help if there is a persistent configuration issue.
Uninstall WSL:
Open PowerShell as Administrator.
Run the following command to unregister WSL:
powershell
wsl --unregister Ubuntu
Reinstall WSL:
Open the Microsoft Store, search for "Ubuntu," and reinstall it.
Set WSL Version to 2:
After reinstalling, set the version to 2:
powershell
wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
