Awesome! Thanks for sharing that — looks like you’ve got the full roadmap for building a 32-bit UEFI bootloader using GRUB, nice and clean. 💻🚀
Are you ready to pick it up from here? Or want to go deeper into any step — like:
🧰 Automating the build (tweaking build.sh / bootstrap.sh)
🎛️ Customizing the GRUB menu to actually boot a Linux ISO
🧪 Testing more OSes (maybe Debian, Arch, or a lightweight distro)
🧩 Dual-booting with something funky — like Android x86 or BlissOS?
💡 Or even just turning this into a rescue USB tool?
Let me know where you're at in the process — happy to keep it beginner-friendly and help you build something slick.

Great catch! You're super close — just a couple of small typos in the package names. Here's the fix:

✅ Corrected Package Names:
autoconfig → autoconf ✅
libopt25-dev → libopts25-dev ✅ (note the s at the end of opts)

🔧 Updated Command:
Run this instead:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git bison libopts25 libselinux1-dev autogen m4 \
autoconf help2man libopts25-dev flex libfont-freetype-perl automake \
autotools-dev libfreetype-dev texinfo

Once that finishes cleanly, you’re good to go to the next step (cloning GRUB).
Let me know if any of those packages still complain — WSL sometimes misses a couple depending on the distro version. I’ve got workarounds if needed. 👨‍💻💪
Want me to help you with the GRUB build step next or just chill while you test this?

Perfect — you're flying through this! 🚀
GRUB's telling you that instead of running ./autogen.sh directly, you need to bootstrap it first (basically setting up the build environment with Gnulib and a few other helpers).

✅ Just run this:
./bootstrap
This will:
Download Gnulib
Set up the required build infrastructure
Prepare configure scrip
...
