Perfect — thanks for breaking that down! You’re doing great, and we’ll take this step-by-step, totally beginner-friendly, using the method from the lamadotcare repo.

This guide will walk you through creating a 32-bit EFI bootloader (bootia32.efi) using a custom-built GRUB.

🛠️ What We’re Building
We’re going to:
Install all the dependencies.
Clone the GRUB source code.
Build GRUB as a 32-bit UEFI app.
Generate the final bootia32.efi file.
Show you what to do with it.

🐧 Step 0: Use a Linux System
Are you on Linux already? If not, install a Linux distro. I recommend Ubuntu or Linux Mint.
If you're on Windows, use:
🖥️ WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) – fastest way (Ubuntu in Microsoft Store).
Or boot from a USB Linux live stick.

Let me know if you need help setting up WSL or Linux — I can walk you through it.
✅ Step 1: Install Dependencies
Open your terminal and run:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git bison libopts25 libselinux1-dev autogen m4 \
autoconf help2man libopts25-dev flex libfont-freetype-perl automake \
autotools-dev libfreetype6-dev texinfo
This installs everything we need to build GRUB from source.

📦 Step 2: Clone GRUB Source Code
Now, let’s grab the source code for GRUB (the bootloader we’ll modify):


cd grub
🏗️ Step 3: Build GRUB for 32-bit UEFI
Now we’ll configure and build GRUB. Still in the grub folder, run:

./bootstrap
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-platform=efi --target=i386 --program-prefix=""
make
This will take a few minutes. It’s building GRUB for the i386 (32-bit) UEFI platform.

🧪 Step 4: Create the EFI File
Once the build finishes, go into the GRUB core folder and generate bootia32.efi:

cd grub-core
../grub-mkimage -d . -o bootia32.efi -O i386-efi -p /boot/grub \
ntfs hfs appleldr boot cat efi_gop efi_uga elf fat hfsplus iso9660 linux \
keylayouts memdisk minicmd part_apple ext2 extcmd xfs xnu part_bsd part_gpt \
search search_fs_file chain btrfs loadbios loadenv lvm minix minix2 reiserfs \
memrw mmap msdospart scsi loopback normal configfile gzio all_video \
gfxterm gettext echo eval
This creates a bootia32.efi file — the 32-bit UEFI bootloader that can load a variety of filesystems and OS kernels.

✅ You did it! You just built a custom EFI bootloader from scratch.

📁 Step 5: Put bootia32.efi on a USB Drive
Plug in a USB stick and format it to FAT32 (you can do this in Ubuntu’s Disks app or GParted).

Mount it, and create the proper folder structure:

mkdir -p /media/$USER/YOUR_USB/EFI/BOOT
cp bootia32.efi /media/$USER/YOUR_USB/EFI/BOOT/
🔁 Replace YOUR_USB with your USB label, or mount manually using sudo mount.

Once done, your USB will have:

markdown
EFI/
└── BOOT/
    └── bootia32.efi
This is the standard EFI boot path for removable media — UEFI firmware looks here when booting from USB.

🧪 Step 6: Test It!
Option 1: Boot It on Real Hardware (with 32-bit UEFI)
Plug the USB into your target device (like a tablet or netbook).

Enter the UEFI/BIOS setup (usually F2/F12/Delete on boot).

Choose your USB device
